## What is Dependency Injection?
// TODO


## Hooks
### `useInjected`
The `useInjected` hook resolves items from the request-scoped container. Services, configurations, constants, everything available inside the request scope.
<br />
`useInjected` resolutions are required. If no registration is found at request level for the specified key, the resolution goes up to the global scope. If still no registration is found, `useInjected` throws an error.
<br />
The are several ways to resolve something:

#### Service by Constructor
You can resolve a service instance by passing its class.
```ts
const orders = useInjected(OrderService);
```

#### Service by Alias
You can resolve a service instance with an alias if previously set.
```ts
const logger = useInjected("ApplicationLogger");
```
You can type-check aliases with [custom service definitions](kit-extending).

#### Environment variables
You can resolve environment variables with the [`KEY`](#key) helper.
```ts
const secret = useInjected(KEY("ENV", "SERVICE-SECRET"));
```
You can type-check environment variables with [explicit definitions](kit-extending).


#### Multiple injection
You can resolve multiple instances at the same time, and destructure the result to assign each one. You can even mix different _requesting keys_.
```ts
const [orders, tracking, logger] = useInjected(OrderService, TrackingService, "ApplicationLogger");
```
Returning instances have defined types, so everything is type checked and safe.


### `useTransaction`

## Decorators
**@httpc/kit** uses the [tsyringe](https://npmjs.org/packages/tsyringe) library as dependency container.

<br />
**httpc/kit** offers additional decorators to cover some lacks tsyringe leaves, like [`optional`](#optional) to specify a non-required dependency, or [`alias`](#alias) to register a class with a specific name.

<br />
Other decorators like [`logger`](#logger) and [`options`](#options), enable new use cases or ease the usage for repetitive or boilerplate code. 

### `optional`
`optional` is a parameter decorator. It allows optional dependencies in constructor injection.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @optional() dependency: AnotherService | unauthorized
    ) {
    }
}
```
<Aside type="warn" title={false}>
Remember to type the parameter with `undefined`, as the resolution will pass `undefined` to instantiate the class.
</Aside>

You can define a default value when the dependency is missing.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @optional({ field: "value" }) configuration: Configuration
    ) {
    }
}
```


### `env`
`env` is a parameter decorator. It inject an environment variable while instantiating a class.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @env("LOG_LEVEL") logLevel: string
    ) {
    }
}
```
The specified environment variable is required to be defined. A missing variable will cause a resolution error.

<br />
You can specify a default value, when the variable is missing. In that case, the environment variable became optional as it fallbacks to the default value specified.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @env("LOG_LEVEL", "info") logLevel: string
    ) {
    }
}
```


### `options` / `optionsOf`
`options` is a parameter decorator. It's part of the _service-options_ pattern, where a class needs a configuration object.
```ts
type MyServiceOptions = {
  field: string
}

class MyService {
    constructor(
        @options() options: MyServiceOptions
    ) {
    }
}
```
By default, the options are required, meaning the container must resolve the options.
<br />
You can make options resolution optional:
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @options(undefined) options: MyServiceOptions | undefined
    ) {
    }
}
```
Or you can set a default value:
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @options({ field: "value" }) options: MyServiceOptions
    ) {
    }
}
```
The options can be registered in two ways: with a class or manually.
<br />
You can use a class with the decorator `optionsOf`:
```ts
@optionsOf(MyService)
class Options implements MyServiceOptions {
    field: "value"
}
```
<Aside type="info" title="guideline" icon="guide">
Implementing the interface is optional. It's strongly suggested for type checking and have editor autocompletion.
</Aside>

You can register options manually with an helper:
```ts
REGISTER_OPTIONS<MyServiceOptions>(MyService, {
    field: "value"
});
```

### `logger`
`logger` is a parameter decorator. It creates a specific logger when the class will be instantiated.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        @logger() private logger: ILogger
    ) {
    }
}
```
Detailed information and advanced usage on the [Logging page](kit-logging).

### `noInject`
`noInject` is a parameter decorator. It allows the resolution to skip a parameter.
```ts
class MyService {
    constructor(
        dependency: AnotherService,
        @noInject() param: string | undefined,
    ) {
    }
}
```
In the above example, the `param` argument will be not resolved and set to `undefined` when resolved.
<br />
`noInject` is useful when the class needs be manually instantiated.
```ts
const service = new MyService(dependencyInstance, "value");
```

### `alias`
`alias` is a class decorator. It allows to resolve the decorating class with the `string` specified.
```ts
@alias("Payments")
class MyPaymentProvider {

}
```
Now, you can resolve the provider with the `string`:
```ts
const payments = useInjected("Payments");
```
The `alias` decorator is used to register a class to an expected implementation. For example, the [bearer authentication](kit-authentication#bearer-authentication) expects a `"BearerAuthentication"` service to be registered to customize advanced behaviors.

### `initializer`
`initializer` is a class decorator. It signals the class has an initializer method, which will run during the application startup.
```ts
@initializer()
class MyService implement IInitialize {
    async initialize(): Promise<void> {
        // do initialization work
    }
}
```
You can implement the `IInitialize` interface to have type checking. This is optional, just for convenience while developing.

<Aside type="warn" title="Reminder">
Initializations are run on **application startup** only. Subsequent resolutions will not run initializations.
<br />
Initializers are useful for singletons, to run some logic before application starts.
