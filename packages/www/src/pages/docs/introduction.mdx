## What is httpc?

**httpc** is a javascript/typescript framework to build function-based API with minimal code and end-to-end type safety.

### Why?
There are scenarios where an API is just a fancy way to expose functions. Likewise, most of the time a client just wants to call a function on the server.
<br />
The _http protocol_ provides too many features (and complexity) to achieve that simple use case. **httpc** is an abstraction over http, making easy to call functions without worrying about the underlying protocol.

<Aside type="info" title={false}>
This is what **httpc** is all about: building an API that speaks functions, arguments and return values, not http verbs, headers, resource paths, data serialization...
</Aside>


### How it works?
You define functions on the server.
```ts
async function getById(productId: string) {
    const product = await db.getProduct(productId);
    if (!product) {
        throw new NotFoundError();
    }

    return product;
}

export default {
    products: {
        getById
    }
}
```

**httpc** provides the tooling to generate an api client to deliver a smooth developer experience.
```ts
const product = await client.products.getById("some-product-id");
```
No fetch requests, no body serialization, just natural function calls.



## Key features

### No boilerplate code
You just write functions and export them. No need to worry how the server will execute them.
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}

function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}`;
}

export default {
    add,
    greet,
}
```

### Modularity
Run common logic via middlewares.
```ts
import { httpCall } from "@httpc/server";

const getPostById = httpCall(
    Authenticated(),    // <-- authentication check
    Validate(String),   // <-- parameters validation
    Cache("5m"),        // <-- result caching
    async (postId: string) => {
        const post = await db.select("posts").where("id", postId);
        if (!post) {
            throw new NotFoundError();
        }

        return post;
    }
);
```
[@httpc/kit](kit-introduction) provides many builtin middlewares covering authentication, validation, logging, etc... Or, you can [create](server-extending) a custom one according your use case.


### Context ubiquity
You can access the request context from everywhere in your application. Be in a handler, middleware o service logic, the context is always available with no need to pass parameters around.
```ts
async function getPosts() {
    const { user } = useContext();

    let category = "news";
    if (user) {
        category = user.preferredCategory;
        trace("Getting user preferred posts");
    }
    
    return await db.select("posts").where("category", category);
}

function trace(message: string) {
    const { requestId } = useContext();
    console.log(`[req:${requestId}] ${message}`);
}

export default {
    getPosts
}
```
You can [extend](server-extending) the context with your own info with full type safety and autocompletion support.

### Hooks
Hooks encapsulate common logic around the request context. By convention hooks adopt the `use` prefix.
```ts
async function addNewComment(postId: string, message: string) {
    const user = useUser();

    if (!useIsAuthorized("comment:create")) {
        throw new ForbiddenError("Cannot add comments");
    }

    return await db.createComment({
        userId: user.id,
        postId,
        message
    });
}
```

[@httpc/kit](kit-introduction) offers several builtin hooks to cache data, to perform authorization checks, to make transactions...


### Client generation
Through **@httpc/cli** you can generate a specific client for your API. The generated client gives the following benefits:

- **Type safety**
  <small>
  With a typed client mirroring the server functions, the development is **type safe** end-to-end. Meaning, when something change on the server, the client breaks at build time. No more shipping wrong code or out-of-sync api definitions.
  </small>

- **Natural syntax**
  <small>
  The generated client delivers a smooth experience with a natural syntax developers are familiar with.
  </small>

  ```ts
  const user = await client.users.search("some@email.com");
  const posts = await client.posts.getByUser(user.id);
  const newComment = await client.posts.addComment(posts[0].id, {
      text: "Hello",
      userId: user.id
  });
  ```

- **Standalone package**
  <small>
  The generated client is a standard package with its own package.json and type files.
  You can consume it directly if you have a monorepo setup. Or you can **publish** it like a standard package to make it available to 3rd parties.
  </small>

  ```shell
  npm install @your-project/api-client
  ```

- **Versioning**
  <small>
  Being a standalone package, you can version the client and manage backward compatibility with semantic versioning.
  </small>


### Highly customizable
- **Data definition**
  <small>
  Customize builtin objects to fit your needs, while keeping autocompletion and type checking working.
  For example you can expand the user object with custom properties:
  </small>
  ```ts
  // file: env.d.ts

  interface IUser {
      firstName: string
      lastName: string
  }
  ```

- **Response editing**
  <small>
  Low-level http customizations (status code, headers management, ...) are available if needed. Usually this isn't necessary, as builtin components cover common use cases.  
  </small>
  
- **Beyond httpc**
  <small>
  The **httpc** server is not limited to function calls. It can handle browser form submissions, web hook callbacks, standard redirects... and, in general, any _http request_.
  With a `Parser`, you can customize how the server processes a request. Handling standard http requests is essential in scenarios where you don't control the client.

## Project status
**httpc** is experimental. It's in its infancy stage. You can try it, adopt it in hobby projects. But it's not ready for production.
<br />
The API is not stable yet. Breaking changes will happen.
<br />
**httpc** is under heavy development. You can checkout the [Changelog](/changelog) and the [Roadmap](/roadmap) for future features.
