This is the first release of the **httpc framework**.

## What is httpc
**httpc** is a javascript/typescript framework for building function-based API with minimal code and end-to-end type safety.

<br />
Major features are:
- natural javascript syntax and easy composition with middlewares
- context propagation and hooks
- heavy focus on type safety
- [@httpc/kit](/docs/kit-introduction) includes many builtin components to handle authentication, validation, caching...
- serverless hosting within single function, a full httpc API
- custom client generation as standard package

## Quick glance
### No boilerplate
You just write functions and export them. No need to worry how the server will execute them.
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}

function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello ${name}`;
}

export default {
    add,
    greet,
}
```

### Modularity
Run common logic via middlewares.
```ts
import { httpCall } from "@httpc/server";

const getPostById = httpCall(
    Authenticated(),    // <-- authentication check
    Validate(String),   // <-- parameters validation
    Cache("5m"),        // <-- result caching
    async (postId: string) => {
        const post = await db.select("posts").where("id", postId);
        if (!post) {
            throw new NotFoundError();
        }

        return post;
    }
);
```

### Context ubiquity
You can access the request context from everywhere in your application.
```ts
async function getPosts() {
    const { user } = useContext();

    let category = "news";
    if (user) {
        category = user.preferredCategory;
        trace("Getting user preferred posts");
    }
    
    return await db.select("posts").where("category", category);
}

function trace(message: string) {
    const { requestId } = useContext();
    console.log(`[req:${requestId}] ${message}`);
}
```

### Hooks
Hooks encapsulate common logic around the request context.
```ts
async function addNewComment(postId: string, message: string) {
    const user = useUser();

    if (!useIsAuthorized("comment:create")) {
        throw new ForbiddenError("Cannot add comments");
    }

    return await db.createComment({
        userId: user.id,
        postId,
        message
    });
}
```
### Serverless
You can host a full **httpc** API inside a serverless environment like Vercel, AWS Lambda or Netlify functions.
This gives the advantage to deploy a single serverless function handling the whole API.

### Client generation
Through **@httpc/cli** you can generate a specific client for your API with a natural syntax developers are familiar with.
```ts
const user = await client.users.search("some@email.com");
const posts = await client.posts.getByUser(user.id);
const newComment = await client.posts.addComment(posts[0].id, {
    text: "Hello",
    userId: user.id
});
```

## Documentation
The home site with documentation is live. For now documentation covers initial steps and basic scenarios. Full documentation is working in progress, as there are many of areas to cover.

## Project status
**httpc** is experimental. It's in its infancy stage. You can try it, adopt it in hobby projects. But it's not ready for production.
<br />
The API is not stable yet. Breaking changes will happen.
<br />
**httpc** is under heavy development. You can checkout the [Changelog](/changelog) and the [Roadmap](/changelog) for future features.
