## The httpc server
The main task of an **httpc server** is to:
1. translate the incoming _standard http request_ into an **httpc request** (parsing)
2. execute the function linked to the httpc request
3. translate the result back into a _standard http response_ (rendering)

<br />
The default translation is performed according the [httpc call convention](/docs/httpc-call-convention), which defines simple rules to identify which server function to call and extract the eventual arguments.

<br />
Any incoming request must match a function, otherwise the _HTTP 404_ is returned.

<Aside type="info">
httpc-aware clients make requests already compliant to the [call convention](/docs/httpc-call-convention) so no configuration is needed server side.<br/>
***
An **httpc server** can handle also standard requests, usually made by clients you don't control, like form submissions by browsers or webhook calls by service providers.
</Aside>

<br />
An **httpc request** is an `HttpCall` object defined with:

<div class="property-table">
| property      | type                   | description  |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|
| `path`        | `string`               | the function handler to call, each function is identified by a unique path |
| `access`      | `"read"` \| `"write"`  | if the request is a read call or a write call          |
| `metadata`    | `Record<string, any>?` | optional metadata enriching the request         |
| `params`      | `any[]`                | The parameters to pass to the function handler  |
</div>


## Request processing flow
The following chart shows the processing of a single _http request_, from the parsing phase to the rendering.

<Svg src="assets/svg/httpc-server-architecture.svg" wrap />


The main blocks are
- **Context**

  For each request, the server creates a dedicated object, the context, that holds all request specific data. The context can be accessed from anywhere through the request processing.


- **Parsing**

  Where the standard _http request_ is translated into an _httpc request_. A `Parser` is responsible for this task. You can define multiple parsers, the server will pick one according some rules explained in the following section.


- **Preprocessing**

  Optionally, any `Rewriter` can preprocess the _httpc request_ and transform it before passing it further on. This step is optional, if no rewriters are defined, the _httpc request_ from the parsing stage is left untouched.


- **Pipeline**

  The pipeline is a set of chained middlewares wrapping the function handler, that is, the actual code defined for that _httpc call_.


- **Rendering**

  Finally, the result (or the error) from the pipeline is transformed into a standard _http response_ by a `Renderer`. Likewise Parsing, you can define multiple renderers, the server will pick the one compatible with the pipeline result.
  


## Context
Before starting the processing flow, the server instantiates a new `IHttpCContext` for each incoming request. The context is a simple plain javascript object, where each field represents a context property.

### Accessing the context
The context can be accessed from anywhere inside the processing flow.

```ts
const context = useContext();
```


Reading a context property is just a line of code

```ts
// accessing property by destructuring
const { requestId } = useContext();

// or use the property hook
const userId = useContextProperty("userId");
```
both work fine and both have typescript with autocompletion support.

<br/>
Writing a property to context is easy
```ts
const user = readUser(); // getting the user from somewhere
// write the property
useContextProperty("userId", user.id);

// optionally, assign the new value at same time
const userId = useContextProperty("userId", user.id);
```

You can access the context from anywhere in the execution context of the request. Being inside a `Parser`, a `Middleware` or a function handler, the context is always available.  
  
There's no need to pass context data as function parameters in your logic. This has a fundamental impact on how to write code and how to test things.

<Aside type="warn" title="Important">
The **@httpc/server** heavy relies on the execution context and its propagation to work property.
Read a deep dive with detailed explanation at [Request context](/docs/server-request-context).
</Aside>


### Builtin properties

<div class="property-table">
| property      | type                   | description |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|
| `requestId`   | `string`               | random uuid auto generated at the beginning |
| `request`     | `http.IncomingMessage` | node native http request                    |
| `startedAt`   | `number`               | unix timestamp as returned by `Date.now()`  |
</div>

<Aside type="info">
The **@httpc/server** provides a basic context, because it follows a non-opinionated, universal approach, with no imposition on how to define or arrange your information. 
********
If you need a more opinionated approach, you should check [@httpc/kit](/docs/kit-introduction) which offers builtin support for a broad range of business concerns like authentication, authorization, validation, caching, ...
</Aside>


### Extending the context
The context isn't limited to the predefined properties. Additional properties can be defined with full typescript support.

Usually middlewares process the request and populate the context with common business data like authentication, session info, cached values, ... which will be available later in the function handler.

<br />
See [Extending](/docs/server-extending) for details.



## Parsing
In the parsing step, the server transforms the _http request_ into an _httpc request_.
This is achieved by an `HttpCServerCallParser`.
<br />
A _httpc request_ is an `HttpCall` object defined with

<div class="property-table">
| property      | type                   | description  |
|:--------------|:-----------------------|:-------------|
| `path`        | `string`               | the function handler to call, each function is identified by a unique path |
| `access`      | `"read"` \| `"write"`  | if the request is a read call or a write call          |
| `metadata`    | `Record<string, any>?` | optional metadata enriching the request         |
| `params`      | `any[]`                | The parameters to pass to the function handler  |
</div>

A parser extracts the required info from the _http request_ and creates the `HttpCall` object.
<br />
By default, the **@httpc/server** uses the builtin [`HttpCCallParser`](#httpccallparser), which follows the [httpc call convention](/docs/httpc-call-convention) to make calling a server function very easy.
<br />
The server is not limited to _httpc calls_ only. It can handle browser form submissions, rest requests, web hooks or any raw _http request_, with custom parsers.
You can have an hybrid server that, in addition to _httpc calls_, can respond to any _http requests_.
<br />
Each parser tells the server if it can manage the request. In that case, the parser returns the `HttpCall` object, otherwise the server will skip to the next parser.
Therefore, the _order_ used to define parsers matters.

<Aside type="tip">
The [`HttpCCallParser`](#httpccallparser) is defined last in the chain, thus any parser you define will take precedence.
</Aside>



### HttpCCallParser
The builtin `HttpCCallParser` provides a straightforward way to expose a json-like API.
It transforms an _http request_ into an `HttpCall` by following the [httpc call convention](/docs/httpc-call-convention). 
<br/>
Details and configuration options are available in [reference](/docs/package-httpc-server).

### Builtin parsers
In addition to json API, the [@httpc/server](/docs/package-httpc-server) package offers several parsers covering additional use cases. For example, `FormUrlEncodedParser` to handle form submissions, or `RawBodyParser` to handle binary data.
<br/>
You can check the [reference](/docs/package-httpc-server) for details.

### Custom parsers
You can define a custom parser to handle a scenario not covered by the builtin parsers. You can define any number of parsers. The order by which the parsers are listed determines the priority.
<br/>
The factory pattern is often used to define a custom parser.
```ts
import { HttpCServerCallParser } from "@httpc/server";

export type CustomerParserOptions = {
  // options
}

export function CustomParser(options: CustomerParserOptions) : HttpCServerCallParser | undefined {
    return async req => {

        if (!shouldParse(req)) {
            return; // this parser does not apply to this request, skip to the next
        }

        // parsing logic and return a call

        const call: HttpCall = { /* */ }

        return call;
    }
}
```

See [Extending](/docs/server-extending) for details.


## Preprocessing
After the parsing, the resulting `HttpCall` can be preprocessed and modified before it executes.
<br />
Common scenarios are:
- Rewriting the call path to alter which function to call
- Adding extra metadata to be used later in the function execution
<br />
You can define multiple rewriters. The server executes them following the order they are listed in a chain-like way, where the output of the first rewriter become the input of the second one.
<br />
The **Preprocessing** is an optional step. If no rewriters are defined, the `HttpCall` continues to the next step, with no modification.

## Pipeline
On each incoming `HttpCall`, the server looks up for the relative function to execute. The match is based on the call _path_. When the sever starts, it setups one pipeline for each function you defined and associates each one with a unique _path_.
More about the _call path_ in the [Call nesting and composition](#call-nesting-and-composition) section.
<br />

After the function is found, the server executes it. If no function is found, the server will respond with the standard _HTTP 404_.
<br />

Each function defines its own pipeline with middlewares.
```ts
import { httpCall } from "@httpc/server";

const getUserById = httpCall(
    Authenticated(),   // <--  authentication middleware
    Validate(String),  // <--  validation middleware
    Cache("5minutes"), // <--  caching middleware

    // actual function logic
    async (userId: string) => { 
        return await db.select("users").where("id", userId).first();
    }
);
```


### Middlewares
A pipeline is a chain of middlewares with the function handler itself at the last step.
A middleware is a piece of code that wraps the execution of the next middleware in the chain. The last middleware wraps the actual function handler. Thus, the sequence of execution is defined by the order by witch the middlewares are defined.

<Svg src="assets/svg/httpc-pipeline-middlewares.svg" wrap />

A middleware is typed by `HttpCServerMiddleware`. Usually a middleware is defined with a factory, a function the returns the middleware itself.
```ts
import { HttpCServerMiddleware } from "@httpc/server";

export function CustomMiddleware(): HttpCServerMiddleware {
    return async (call, next) => {

        // middleware logic
        // with a call to the next middleware somewhere 
        return await next(call);

    };
}
```

With a middleware you can execute shared logic among all your functions. Common scenarios include:
- Pre checks<br/>
  <small>Run code before the function and block it if necessary</small>

- Passthrough<br/>
  <small>Run code before and after the function with no impact on the function logic</small>

- After processing/Catches<br />
  <small>Run code after the function or capture errors in the following steps</small>

</Aside>

### Call nesting and composition

Each call is associated with a unique path, in a tree-like folder/file structure.

You can arrange and group functions as you like. For example you can have `users` and `articles` functions in the following structure
```js
/users
   /getById
   /create
   /update
/articles
   /getById
   /getByUserId
```
For the `getById` users function, the call the path is: `/users/getById` and, from the client, the code to call the function will be
```ts
const user = await client.users.getById(...);
```

You can have a flat structure where all functions are available at the first level, or you can nest and group them. The structure is just a plain object where each property represents a function call.
<br />
To group functions just assign them to a property, as a sub-object.

```ts
const getById = httpCall( /** omitted */ );

const create = httpCall( /** omitted */ );

export default {
    users: { // <-- users function group
        getById,
        create
    }
}

```

From the client, the calls will be available with the `users` property.
```ts
const user = await client.users.getById(userId);

const newUser = await client.users.create({
    username: "test@test.com",
    password: "strong-password"
});
```

Or, for better code organization, you can compose calls with standard imports. Define all users calls inside a dedicated file
```ts
// file: users.calls.ts

const getById = httpCall( /** omitted */ );

const create = httpCall( /** omitted */ );

export default {
    getById,
    create
}
```

and import them in the main calls file
```ts
// file: calls.ts
import users from "./users.calls";
import articles from "./articles.calls";

export default {
    users,
    articles,
}

```


You can further nest calls group inside another one.
Because a call group is a simple javascript object, you can nest calls with a simple property assignment.
<br />
For example if you want `friends` calls as sub calls within `users`, just set a property `friends` on the `users` call object.

```ts
// file: friends.calls.ts

const add = httpCall(
    Validate(String, String, String),
    async (userId: string, friendId: string, listId: String) => {
        // omitted
    }  
);

export default {
  add
}
```

You can import calls and compose them, like there are a simple object.
```ts
// file: users.calls.ts
import friends from "./friends.calls";

const getById = httpCall( /** omitted */ );

export default {
    friends, // <-- composing all friends calls as nested
    getById,
}

```

From the client, the nested calls are available as properties.
```ts
const friend = await client.users.friends.add(userId, friendId, "friend-list-2");
```

### Result
Anything a function handler returns will be the result. An handler can also throw an error to halt the execution. There are several [builtin errors](/docs/package-httpc-server#errors) that map to the relative http error like `BadRequestError`, `UnauthorizedError` and so on.
<br/>

If an error is thrown, the server will catch it, stop the pipeline execution and the error itself will be the result.
<br/>

The pipeline result, either the object returned by the function handler (maybe post processed by the middleware chain) or the error if the an exception is thrown, will be passed to the rendering step.



## Rendering
In the rendering step, the server transforms the pipeline result into an actual http response. This is achieved by several renderers.

An `HttpCServerRenderer` transforms the pipeline result into an `HttpCServerResponse`. You can define multiple renderers to handle different use cases, like a json response, an html template render, a redirect or, in general, anything the http protocol supports.
<br />

The **@httpc/server** package offers some builtin renderers. In addition, custom renderers can be defined.
```ts
import { HttpCServerRenderer, HttpCServerResponse } from "@httpc/server";

export function MyCustomRenderer() : HttpCServerRenderer {
    return async (result: unknown) : HttpCServerResponse | undefined => {
        
        if (!canIRenderThis(result)) {
            return; // this render doesn't handle this result, skip to the next render
        }

        // transform logic
        const response = /* omitted */

        return response;
    };
}
```

The server runs the renders in order. Thus the definition order matters as it sets the run sequence. A renderer can skip the transformation, if it cannot handle the result. When a renderer returns a response, the rendering phase stops, no additional renderers is executed and the response sent to the client.

<br />
As the **@httpc/server** is tailored for the json-API scenario, by default the builtin `JsonRenderer` is added to the renderer list. The `JsonRenderer` serializes any result object into json and sent it to the client.

<Aside type="tip">
The builtin `JsonRenderer` is defined last in the renderers list, thus any renderer you define will take precedence.
</Aside>

A pipeline result can be:
- `undefined` or `null`
  <small>
  If the handler returns nothing, the server will respond with a standard http _204 No Content_
  </small>

- `HttpCServerResponse`
  <small>
  An handler can return an `HttpCServerResponse` to bypass the rendering phase. In this case, no renderer is run and the result, which is a already a response, is sent directly to the client. 
  </small>

- an object _instanceof_ `Error`
  <small>
  If the handler throws an error or the server catches an error during the pipeline execution (ie, inside middlewares), the result will an `Error` instance.
  </small>

- any other object instance
  <small>
  Anything else will be processed as is by the renderers.
  </small>
