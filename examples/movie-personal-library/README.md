# httpc example: Personal Movie Library
This in an example on how to build a full [httpc](https://github.com/giuseppelt/httpc) API with a console client to access it.

The _Personal Movie Library_ is a movie catalogue service that allows the user to browse movies, get movie details and search movies by actor and director.

The project will feature:

- the Movie Library **API server** (the service provider)

  The server application that exposes the library functionalities like movie details and searching
 
- the Movie Library **Console** (the service consumer)

  The client application that talks to the server to get the data, shows movie info on screen and interact with the user


This project is build upon **@httpc/server**.
