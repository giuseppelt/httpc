## The convention
The **httpc call convention** describes a set of rules to structure an _http request_ so it can be easily translated into a function call.

<br />
An **httpc call** is an abstraction over the HTTP protocol. It shapes the _http request_ in order to:
1. identity which function to call
2. send the function arguments
3. receive the function result

<br />
The **httpc call convention** provides a simple way to build function-based APIs without worrying much about the underling HTTP complexity.


<Aside type="info">
The **httpc call convention** is implemented by the builtin `HttpCCallParser` which is included by default with any [httpc server](/docs/server-architecture) configuration.
*** 
An **httpc server** can handle any _http request_, even when non **httpc** compliant, with [custom parsers](/docs/server-extending#custom-parser).
</Aside>

<br />
The **httpc call convention** defines two [Conformity Levels](#conformity-level):

- [Strict](#strict-mode)

  A request must conform to all _convention rules_, otherwise it will be rejected.
  This is useful when receiving requests from _httpc-aware_ clients like `HttpCClient` or the custom client [generated](/docs/client-generation) from an API.

- [Loose](#loose-mode)

  The server goes around some rules and tries to understand the request even when not strictly following the convention.
  **Loose mode** can be used to accept _standard http requests_ from browsers, rest client or server webhooks.


<Aside type="tip">
You can have sections of your api with different conformity levels.
<br />
For example you can set the **strict mode** for a sub/path used by _httpc-aware_ clients, and another sub/path in **loose mode** which targets other clients like browsers.
</Aside>


### The Rules
The rules aim to identify:
1. **the function** to execute

    The http _request path_ is used as _call path_, that is, the unique id of any server function.

    <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    When a request is sent to `https://domain/products/getById`

    <br />
    the server expects a function on `/products/getById` to be defined.

    ***

    A server can also bind to a subpath, for example `/api`, so when a request is sent to `https://domain/api/orders/create`

    <br />
    the server expects a function on `/orders/create` to be defined.
    </details>
    <br />

2. the function **arguments**

    In the basic usage, the **http verb** doesn't play a role. So by convention, the <mark>POST</mark> verb is used for any function call.
    
    <br/>
    The arguments are sent with the request body as a json serialized array, with a <mark>content-type</mark> header equals to `application/json`. When the function has no arguments, an empty array `[]` is sent.

    <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    The function call `add(1, 2)` corresponds to the _http request_:
    ```
    POST /add
    Content-Type: application/json

    [1, 2]
    ```
    ***

    Same, with a single-argument function call `update({ name: "new-name" })`
    ```
    POST /update
    Content-Type: application/json

    [{"name": "new-name"}]
    ```
    </details>

    Advanced usage involves both <mark>GET</mark> and <mark>POST</mark> verbs, read the [following section](#advanced-rules) for details.
    <br />


3. the function **result**

    The _exact_ response status code has no relevance. An **httpc client** will evaluate the response with:
    - <mark>status</mark> < 400: result is a success
    - <mark>status</mark> >= 400: result is an error

    An httpc server will respond with a content-type of `application/json`. The result will be parsed from the body as json. The whole body is the result. If the body is empty, the result is `undefined`.

    <br />
    When the result is a success, the parsed value is returned to the caller. If the result is an error, an **httpc client** will throw a `HttpCClientError` with the body as error data.
    
    <br />
    More details on [Error result](#error-result) section.


### Advanced Rules
In case interoperability with _http-level_ cache is required, the **httpc call convention** defines two **call access**: `"read"` and `"write"`. Because http caching works only with the <mark>GET</mark> verb, the call access `"read"` adopts the <mark>GET</mark> to send the request.

<br/>
The convention establishes:

- **read** call
    
    The request is sent using the <mark>GET</mark> verb. The request path still identifies the call path, that is, the unique function to invoke.

    <br />
    Function arguments are sent via query string. The `$p` param is a json serialization of the arguments.

    <details>
    <summary>Examples</summary>

    The function call `getPost("id-10")` corresponds to the _http request_:
    ```
    GET /getPost?$p=["id-10"]
    ```
    ***

    A no-argument function call `getLatestPost()` can avoid to send the query string:
    ```
    GET /getLatestPost
    ```
    </details>

- **write** call

    The default call access and follows the _basic_ rules mentioned in the [previous section](#the-rules).

    The request is sent using the <mark>POST</mark> verb.


<br />
A call assess is simply a way to send the underlying http request. With no specification, the default call access `"write"` is used. The call access `"read"` is introduced with the single purpose of interoperability with the http-level cache. 

<br />
The names `"read"` and `"write"` are just a convention and don't define different behaviors. On **httpc** level, there's no difference, both call access produce the same invocation with the same processing.

<Aside type="info">
**http caching** is a concern somewhat _external_ to the function invocation per se.
The httpc framework provides [helpers](/docs/kit-caching) to set http caching headers with flexible configurations.
</Aside>


### HTTP vs HTTPC
// TODO
#### Http verb
#### Headers
#### response status code


## Error result
When a request fails, an **httpc server** sends the error details back to the client as json with the response body. The <mark>content-type</mark> header will be `application/json`.

<br />
When the response has <mark>status</mark> `>= 400`, it's considered an error. An **httpc client** will throw a `HttpCClientError` with the relevant info.

<br />
An error is defined with:
<div class="property-table">
| property   | type       | description                     |
|:-----------|:-----------|:--------------------------------|
| `status`   | `number`   | the _http response_ status code |
| `error`    | `string`   | an application-defined error code      |
| `message`  | `string?`  | optional message to explain the error |
| `data`     | `object?`  | optional extra data for context |
</div>

<br />
<Aside type="tip" title="Guideline" icon="guide">
The specific response status code shouldn't determine a specific behavior. The `status` is sent for interoperability reasons. Non-httpc applications may need the status code to process requests.
<br />
Client logic should rely only on the `error` code as it's defined by the application with a non-ambiguous meaning.
</Aside>


### Examples
A basic error response defines the _request status code_ and an `error`.
```json
{
    "status": 401,
    "error": "unauthorized"
}
```

An optional message can be sent to better explain the error.
```json
{
    "status": 404,
    "error": "not_found",
    "message": "The article(U-NkrLT2) is not found"
}
```

Extra data can be added to provide error context.
```json
{
    "status": 400,
    "error": "bad_request",
    "message": "Some parameter are not valid",
    "data": {
        "username": "Must be at least 10 char"
    }
}
```




## Call access

### Read call
A `read` call uses the http <mark>GET</mark> verb and sends arguments via a json-serialized query string `$p` parameter.
<Tabs client:idle tabs={["HttpCClient", "cli", "fetch", "HTTP"]} initial="httpcclient">
    <Fragment slot="panel.httpcclient">
```ts
import { HttpCClient } from "@httpc/client";

const client = new HttpCClient();
const result = await client.read("call/path", arg1, arg2, ...argN);
```        
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="panel.cli">
```
httpc call --read call/path arg1 arg2 argN
```    
    </Fragment>    
    <Fragment slot="panel.fetch">
```ts
function sendReadCall(callPath: string, parameters: any[]) {
    const url = this.apiEndpoint + "/" + callPath + "?$p=" + JSON.stringify(parameters);

    return fetch(url, { method: "GET" });
}
```      
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="panel.http">
```
GET /call/path?$p=[ serialized-parameters ]
```    
    </Fragment>
</Tabs>



### Write call
A `write` call uses the http <mark>POST</mark> verb and sends arguments via body with a json-serialized content.
<Tabs client:idle tabs={["HttpCClient", "cli", "fetch", "HTTP"]} initial="httpcclient">
    <Fragment slot="panel.httpcclient">
```ts
import { HttpCClient } from "@httpc/client";

const client = new HttpCClient();
const result = await client.write("call/path", arg1, arg2, ...argN);
```        
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="panel.cli">
```
httpc call call/path arg1 arg2 argN
```    
    </Fragment>    
    <Fragment slot="panel.fetch">
```ts
function sendWriteCall(callPath: string, parameters: any[]) {
    const url = this.apiEndpoint + "/" + callPath;

    return fetch(url, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        body: JSON.stringify(parameters)
    });
}
```      
    </Fragment>    
    <Fragment slot="panel.http">
```
POST /call/path
Content-Type: application/json

[ serialized-parameters ]
``` 
    </Fragment>
</Tabs>



## Conformity level

### Strict mode

In **strict mode** any _http requests_ must conform to all **httpc call convention** rules:

1. **http verb** must be either <mark>GET</mark> or <mark>POST</mark>
2. **http verb** must match the call access:
    - for `read` calls the http verb must be <mark>GET</mark>
    - for `write` calls the http verb must be <mark>POST</mark>
3. **function arguments** must be passed:
    - for `read` calls via query string parameter `$p` and must be a serialized json array
    - for `write` calls via body content and must be a serialized json array, with a <mark>content-type</mark> header set to `application/json`
    
    if no argument is necessary for the call, they can omitted:
    - for `read` calls the query string parameter `$p` can be omitted
    - for `write` calls the body can be empty
    
<br />
In **strict mode**, the server will reject the non-conformant requests with a `BadRequestError`.

### Loose mode

In **loose mode**, the server will parse the _http request_ in a more lenient way. **Loose mode** is useful when you need to adapt the parsing with some additional flexibility.

<Aside type="tip" title="example">
In a _rest post request_, the body is a single object, not an array as the httpc call convention states. In **loose mode**, the server will accept the request and use the body as the first argument of the function call.
</Aside>

<br />
In **loose mode**, the server can accept:

1. the **http verb** can be any of <mark>GET</mark>, <mark>POST</mark>, <mark>PUT</mark> or <mark>PATCH</mark> with no match required to the relative `call access`.

2. for <mark>GET</mark> requests:
    - if the query string has the `$p` param, it will parsed as in **strict mode**
    - otherwise, the query string will be transformed in an object where each query param will be an object field

    <details>
        <summary>Example</summary>

        The query string:
        ```
        GET /search?term=test&language=en
        ```

        will be parsed into:
        ```ts
        search({
            term: "test",
            language: "en"
        });
        ```
    </details>


3. for requests with body (<mark>POST</mark>, ...):
    - if the body contains a non-array value( `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`), it will be used as the first and unique argument for the function call

<br />
In **loose mode**, the server still accepts **strict httpc requests**. In other words, **loose mode** are additional rules on top the **strict mode** ones.
