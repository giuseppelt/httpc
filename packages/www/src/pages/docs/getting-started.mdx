## Before you start
You need to pick the base library you want to create your project with.

<div class="container-grid-2col my-3">
<PackageCard title="@httpc/server"
  description="Essential approach to function calls over httpc">
- Un-opinionated
- No predefined design or structure
- Direct approach to handle the requests
- No dependency
</PackageCard>

<PackageCard title="@httpc/kit"
  description="Structured approach with many components read-to-go">
- Highly opinionated
- Builtin authentication, validation, caching etc..
- Rich utilities to aid with common business concerns: logging, transactions, etc..
- Service oriented with dependency injection
</PackageCard>
</div>


If your project consists of few simple functions and you're comfortable dealing with raw http requests, you can start with **@httpc/server**.
Otherwise, it's strongly suggested to build upon **@httpc/kit** as it offers lots of features you'll end up using anyway.

<Aside type="tip">
If you start with **@httpc/server**, you can move to **@httpc/kit** with very little effort

## Installation

### Requirements
- node v16.13+
- npm or equivalent package manager


### Start from a template
You can quickly setup a project from a template.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm create @httpc
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm create @httpc
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn create @httpc
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>


### Manual setup
If you already have a package, you can manually add **httpc** to your project.
<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # for server-based projects
  npm install @httpc/server
  # for kit-based projects
  npm install @httpc/kit tsyringe reflect-metadata

  # used in both, for development tasks
  npm install @httpc/cli --save-dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # for server-based projects
  pnpm add @httpc/server
  # for kit-based projects
  pnpm add @httpc/kit tsyringe reflect-metadata

  # used in both, for development tasks
  pnpm add @httpc/cli --save-dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # for server-based projects
  yarn add @httpc/server
  # for kit-based projects
  yarn add @httpc/kit tsyringe reflect-metadata

  # used in both, for development tasks
  yarn add @httpc/cli --dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>


### Start the server
If you used a template, you can start the development server. Enter the project directory and run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

### Generate the client
After you wrote some functions, you can generate the client package. In a project directory, just run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npm run generate:client
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm generate:client
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn run generate:client
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Underneath it runs the **@httpc/cli** with `httpc client generate`.
You can checkout more about [client generation](client-generation) with all the advanced options.

## Project structure
The minimal project is composed by:
```
project/
├─ src/
│  ├─ calls/
│  │  └─ index.ts
│  └─ index.ts
├─ httpc.json
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json
```
<CodeTabs client:idle tabs={["src/index.ts", "src/calls/index.ts", "httpc.json"]}>
  <Fragment slot="0">
    ```ts
    import { createHttpCServer } from "@httpc/server";
    import calls from "./calls";


    const server = createHttpCServer({
      calls,
      cors: true
    });

    server.listen();
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="1">
    ```ts
    function echo(message: string) {
        return message;
    }

    function greet(name: string) {
        return `Hello ${name}`;
    }


    export default {
        echo,
        greet,
    }
    ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="2">
    ```json
    {
      "name": "@service/api-client",
      "entry": "./src/calls/index.ts",
      "dest": "./client",
    }
    ```
  </Fragment>
</CodeTabs>

The core files:
- **src/index.ts**
  <small>
  The entry point of your application, where you setup the **httpc server**. Here you can specify parsers, global middlewares and in general application-wide settings.
  </small>

- **src/calls/index.ts**
  <small>
  The functions you want to expose. You can organize and group your calls in multiple files. Call files are easily composed and nested as they are standard javascript objects.
  </small>

- **httpc.json**
  <small>
  The configuration used to generate the client of your API. In addition to the `httpc.json` file, you can specify the configuration in [other ways](client-generation#configuration).
  </small>
