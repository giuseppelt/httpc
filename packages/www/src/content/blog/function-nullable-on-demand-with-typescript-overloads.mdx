## Introduction
Functions returning a _non-null_ value keep the code flow linear because you don't have to if-check the value for the undefined case. But sometimes, you want the same function to return a _nullable_ value, because in some scenarios that value is optional and not always available.

<br />
In this post we'll introduce a technique to make a function that returns a _non-null_ value, to return also a nullable one when the scenario dictates it.

<br />
This technique allows to define a single function and have it behaves both ways: returning a defined value and, optionally, a _maybe undefined_ value.

<br />
This technique is heavily used in the [httpc framework](/repository) to provide helpers with nice ergonomics that minimize written code while preserving full type-safety.

<br/>
In the following sections, the [`useUser`](/docs/kit-authentication#useuser) function is used as example. It returns a _non-null_ user by default, but it can optionally return _undefined_ in scenarios where an anonymous user is allowed.


## On demand nullability
Let's define an hypothetical API function `getMyProfile` which returns, as the name suggests, the profile of the current logged user.
```ts
async function getMyProfile() {
    const user = useUser(); // <-- here user is defined
    const profile = await db.getUserProfile(user.id);
    return profile;
}
```

In order to have a cleaner code, you want the `useUser` to return a _defined non-null_ user. For non authenticated user, it must throw an exception to halt the execution. The eventual exception will be dealt in an higher and central place, like a global error handler.

<br />
With this behavior, `useUser` allows to have a linear code flow with no need to add null checks every time.

<br />
But there are scenarios where the user is optional and you don't want to clog the code with try/catch to handle the case when the user is not present.

<br />
`useUser` allows to enable _nullability_ on demand, that is, to return a _maybe undefined_ user without trowing an exception when the user is not logged in.

```ts
async function getDiscounts() {
    const user = useUser("optional"); // <-- here user can be undefined
    if (user) {
        return await db.getUserDiscounts(user.id);
    } else {
        return []; // no discounts for anonymous
    }
}
```

## Context and use case
In typescript you can annotate a function return value as `undefined` to signal that the function can return a _non-defined_ value in some cases.
```ts
function getCurrentUser(): User | undefined {

}
```

With the previous function, you have to always check the return value to be sure it's safe to use:
```ts
const user = getCurrentUser();
if (user) {
    // do something with the user
} else {
    // the user is not logged in
}
```

<br />
To simplify your code and avoid tedious repetitions, you shouldn't have to write null checks every time because for the most part the value is expected to be defined.

<br />
In real-world application there are many functions like `getCurrentUser` where the usage boils down to two cases:
- often you want the function to return a defined value because the value is required
- in few cases, you want a nullable value because the the value can be optional

<br />
 A possible solution is to define a new helper function that throws when the value is not available:
```ts
function getCurrentUserRequired() {
    const user = getCurrentUser();
    if (!user) {
        throw new Error("User not logged in");
    }

    return user;
}
```

In a _required_ context, the calling function will use the helper:
```ts
function printUserId() {
    const user = getCurrentUserRequired();
    console.log(user.id); // <-- here the user is defined
}
```
and in cases where the value is optional, you will use the original function.
```ts
function getUserDisplayName() {
    const user = getCurrentUser();
    if (user) {
        return user.username;
    } else {
        return "Anonymous";
    }
}
```

Although the helper-function solution fulfills the goal to avoid nullable checks on every usage, it has two major side effects:
- you have to define a specific helper function for each base function
- code duplication and possible divergent behavior among every helper

## Typescript overloads on the rescue
You can use overloads to have the same function return both a defined and a nullable value. You can default to a required value and with a parameter switch to a nullable on demand.
```ts
function getCurrentUser(): User;
function getCurrentUser(mode: "optional"): User | undefined;
function getCurrentUser(mode?: "optional") {
    const user = // get the user from somewhere 
    if (!user && mode !== "optional") {
        throw new UnauthorizedError();
    }

    return user;
}
```

### Example as required
You can use the function as is because it defaults to non-nullable:
```ts
function printUserId() {
    const user = getCurrentUser();
    console.log(user.id); // <-- here user is defined
}
```

As a `getCurrentUser` consumer, you want it to always return a **defined** user or throwing an error if not, so the execution is halted with the eventual exception handled in an higher level.

<br />
In this way you don't need to check every time if the user is defined and have a streamlined code flow.

### Example as optional
When the user is optional, you can use the second overload and _activate_ the nullability on demand.
```ts
function getUserDisplayName() {
    const user = getCurrentUser("optional");
    if (user) { // <-- here user can be undefined
        return user.username;
    } else {
        return "Anonymous";
    }
}
```

### Opposite default behavior
In a scenario where the most common case is to have an optional value, you can reverse the implementation and default to a nullable value and activate on demand the required case.

```ts
function getCurrentUser(): User | undefined;
function getCurrentUser(mode: "required"): User;
function getCurrentUser(mode?: "required") {
    const user = // get the user from somewhere 
    if (!user && mode === "required") {
        throw new Error("User is not logged in");
    }

    return user;
}
```

The usage from the consumer perspective became:
```ts
// here user can be undefined
const user = getCurrentUser();

// here user is defined
const user = getCurrentUser("required");
console.log("The user is :" + user.displayName);
```

## Another example: Single entity query
This technique is not limited to parameter-less function, you can use it with function with parameters too.

<br />
Let's define a `Data` class as a wrapper around a db with basic query functions.

```ts
class Data {
    async getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<User>;
    async getUserProfile(userId: string, mode: "optional"): Promise<User | undefined>;
    async getUserProfile(userId: string, mode?: "optional") {
        const profile = await db.select("profiles").where("userId", userId);
        if (!profile && mode !== "optional") {
            throw new Error("Profile not found");
        }

        return profile;
    }
}
```

Usage when the return value is required:
```ts
const profile = await data.getUserProfile(userId);
// here profile is defined
```

And the usage when the return value is not required:
```ts
const profile = await data.getUserProfile(userId, "optional");
// here profile can be undefined

if (!profile) {
    // do something if the profile is not defined
}
```

## Conclusion
Thanks to typescript overloads a function can be annotated with both a defined and _maybe undefined_ return value.

<br />
A function defined with this pattern keeps the code linear, centralize the handling when the value is unavailable and provide a nice ergonomics to activate the case where the value is optional. And everything is kept under strong type-safety.

<br />
Have a look at the [httpc framework](https://httpc.dev) which adopts this and many other techniques and patterns to build APIs with minimal code and strong type safety.
